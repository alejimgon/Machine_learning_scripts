## Getting Started

To get started with any script, navigate to the respective directory and follow the instructions provided in the script files.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`
- `tensorflow` (for deep learning projects)
